// check if dead
	 // if dead, then return i32 min
	// then look at the smallest path to the closest food, if there is no path to any food, then return max negative
	// smallest path to the head of the nearest snake that is smaller than it.
		// make an array of all snakes
		// remove all snakes larger than myself, and are myself
		// find the one that has the closest head to me (A*)
		   // if no snake is reachable, then add 0 to the score
		   // otherwise subtract the length of the path from score.
	// calculate food ownership
		// iterate through each food piece
			// see if I am the closest snake
		// add the number of food i am closest to * 2 to score.
	// calculate area ownership
		// iterate through each empty square
			// see if I am closest to that square
		// add the number of squares i am closest to * 1 to score.
