# warpy\_snake

A Rust [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.org) template built using [warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp). You can find snake customizations on lines 12-15 and the move endpoint at line 27. Adding your name/email and adding the name of your snake to `Cargo.toml` is also recommended. The snake listens on the port set by the PORT environment variable.
